# A-Lightweight-2D-Projection-CNN-Framework-for-MRI-Based-Brain-Age-Prediction
Brain age is an important biomarker that quantifies age-related structural changes in the human brain, with potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring of healthy aging. We propose a computationally efficient deep learning model based on two-dimensional (2D) projections that balances efficiency and accuracy.
